\begin{abstract}
The correctness of electronic vote-counting software is 
crucial in establishing the trust in electronic voting. 
However, most vote-counting programs, used in 
various jurisdiction for legally binding election, establish
correctness by means of testing which is not sufficient, and often
fails to identify rare corner cases.
We argue that legally binding vote-counting software 
should be formally verified and their correctness should be 
evaluated against some well established framework from social choice theory, 
e.g., one 
such framework for preferential voting methods is Arrow's Impossibility 
Theorem.
\footnote{DP: I don't see the relation to arrow's theorem here?}

In this work, 
we give machine checked formal proofs that our Coq implementation of the Schulze method,
a preferential voting method, 
follows the Condorcet winner property. We leave the formal machine-checked proof of 
other properties, e.g., reversal symmetry, Pareto, monotonicity, etc., for future work. 
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first machine-checked proof of 
properties of the Schulze method implementation, and in fact, any preferential vote-counting 
implementation.

\section{Introduction}
    The Schulze method \cite{Schulze:2011:NMC}, a preferential
    voting method, has gained popularity in recent years
   when it comes to electing the candidates of many open source 
    software communities, Wikipedia, and the Pirate Parties in
    various countries. At the time of writing, 
    is used by more  than  60 organizations  with  more  than  900,000  eligible  
    members  in  total \cite{schulze2020schulze}. One particular reason for this popularity is that it 
    enjoys many desirable properties that have been  formulated in
    social choice theory.
    Many of these are already established in the Schulze's original paper \cite{Schulze:2011:NMC}, e.g., Condorcet winner, Pareto, reversal symmetry, monotonicty, 
    etc. Moreover, it fails on independence of 
    irrelevant alternatives (IIA) criterion, a consequence of the impossibility theorem \cite{arrow1950difficulty} which states that no preferential voting 
    method can have all the properties. 

    In this work, we establish that our implementation of Schulze method \cite{Pattinson:2017:SVE}
    conforms to the Condorcet winning criterion. It is ongoing work and in  
    future, we would like to establish that our implementation follows all the other properties, 
    e.g. reversal symmetry, Pareto, monotonicity, etc. 
    More importantly, it would be interesting to establish that our implementation 
    fails on IIA criterion. The 
    source code for this ongoing work can be accessed from the GitHub 
    repo\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mukeshtiwari/Schulzeproperties/blob/master/Schulzeprop.v}}
    
    \section{The Schulze Method}
    In this section, we give a brief overview of the Schulze method and 
    necessary formalisation details to make it self-contained. We invite the 
    curious reader to read our paper \cite{Pattinson:2017:SVE} for more details. 
    
    
    The  method itself rests on the relative margins between two
    candidates, i.e. the number of voters that prefer one candidate
    over another. The margin induces an ordering between candidates,
    where a candidate $c$ is more preferred than $d$ if more voters
    prefer $c$ over $d$ than vice versa. One can construct simple
    examples (see e.g. \cite{Rivest:2010:OSW}) where this order does
    not have a maximal element (a so-called Condorcet Winner).
    Schulzeâ€™s observation is that this ordering can be made
    transitive by considering sequences of candidates (called
    paths).  Given candidates $c$ and $d$, a path between $c$ and
    $d$ is a
    sequence of candidates $p= (c,c_{1}, \dots ,c_{n},d)$ that joins
    $c$ and $d$, and the \emph{strength} of a path is the minimal margin
    between adjacent nodes. This induces the generalised margin
    between candidates $c$ and $d$ as the strength of the strongest path
    that joins $c$ and $d$.  A candidate $c$ then wins a Schulze count if
    the generalised margin between $c$ 
    and any other candidate $d$ is at least as large as the
    generalised margin between $d$ and $c$. It is known that every
    election has a winner, but the winner may not be uniquely
    determined (e.g. in the case where no votes have been cast at
    all).
    In more detail:

\begin{enumerate}  

\item Consider an election with a set of $t$ candidates
    $C$ = $\{c_1,\dots,c_t\}$ and 
	a set of $n$ votes $P$ = $\{b_1,\dots,b_n\}$. A vote
	is a function $b: C \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ that 
	assigns a natural 
	number (the preference) to each candidate.  Note that two
  candidates may receive the same preference. 
	We recover a strict total 
	preorder $<_b$ on the candidates by setting $c <_b d$ if $b(c) > b(d)$, i.e. 
	candidate $c$ is less preferred over candidate $d$ if the natural number $b(c)$ is greater
	than the natural number $b(d)$. 
	
\item We construct a margin matrix $\mathrm{marg} : C \times C \to \mathbb{Z}$ as follows: 
    given two candidates $c, d \in C$, the \emph{margin} of $c$ over $d$ is
    the number of voters that prefer $c$ over $d$ minus the number of voters
    that prefer $d$ over $c$. In symbols:
\[
  \mathit{marg} (c, d) = \sharp \lbrace b \in P \mid c >_b d \rbrace -
            \sharp \lbrace b \in P \mid d >_b c \rbrace
\] where $\sharp$ denotes cardinality.


\item A directed \emph{path} from
candidate $c$ to candidate $d$ is a sequence $p \equiv c_0, \dots, c_{w+1}$
of candidates with $c_0 = c$ and $c_{w+1} = d$ ($w \geq 0$), and the
\emph{strength}, $\mathrm{st}$, of path $p$ is the minimum margin of adjacent
nodes, i.e.
\[ \mathrm{st}(c_0, \dots, c_{w+1}) = \min \lbrace \mathrm{marg} (c_i, c_{i+1}) \mid 0 
\leq i \leq w \rbrace. \]
\item  A generalised margin matrix, $M$, denote the strength of the strongest path
	between two candidates, i.e. 
	\[ M(c, d) = \max \lbrace \mathrm{st} (p) : p \text{ is path from } c \text{ to } d\rbrace \]
	
\item The winning set  is defined as 
 \[ W =  \lbrace c \in C : \forall d \in C \setminus \{c\}, M (c, d) \geq M (d, c) \rbrace\]

\end{enumerate}


Our Coq formalisation models the set of candidates as a type.
Moreover, it postulates that the type of candidates 
is finite and non-empty with decidable equality. For our purpose, 
the easiest way of stipulating that a type be finite is to require existence of a 
list containing all inhabitants of this type \cite{10.1145/2808098.2808102}.

 \begin{minted}{coq}
Parameter cand : Type.
Parameter cand_all : list cand.
Hypothesis cand_fin : 
 forall c: cand, In c cand_all.
Hypothesis cand_not_nil : 
 cand_all <> nil.
Hypothesis dec_cand : 
 forall n m : cand, {n = m} + {n <> m}.


\end{minted}

One easy way to achieve all of the above is to implement
\texttt{cand} as an indictive type with one nullary constructor for
each candidate.

We define a boolean function (step 5) that determines 
(the Schulze) election winners based on 
the generalised margin matrix (step 4). ($M \text{ } \mathrm{marg} \text{ } 
(\mathrm{length} \text{ } \mathrm{cand\_all}) \text{ } c \text{ } d$ 
in the $\mathrm{schulze\_winner}$ definition is Coq encoding of the generalised margin matrix, 
$M \text{ } (c, \text{ }d)$, defined in step 4. The syntactic differences do not matter 
for this discussion.)
\footnote{DP: which syntactic differences?}
\footnote{DP: why a boolean function and not a proposition?}
 \begin{minted}{coq}
Definition schulze_winner 
  (marg : cand * cand -> Z) 
  (c : cand) := forallb (fun d => 
  (M marg (length cand_all) d c) <=? 
  (M marg (length cand_all) c d))
  cand_all.
\end{minted}


\section{Properties of Schulze Method}
	 We have a boolean function,  \textit{schulze\_winner},  that 
	 elects the winner,  the key question is that how do we know that 
	 this winner is indeed the real winner,  intended by the voters, and 
	 not because of the software bug in the implemetation.  In our 
	 original paper, we have given two definitions of 
	 winners, one in Prop (logical) and one in Type (computational) and 
	 proved that both implemetations are equivalent. 
   \footnote{DP: How do they relate to the boolean function above?}
   \footnote{DP: the typle level definition can't be understood
   without context, e.g. what does co-closed mean?}
	  
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition wins_prop (c: cand) : Prop := 
 forall d: cand, exists k: Z,
  Path k c d /\ 
 (forall l, Path l d c -> l <= k)
	 
Definition wins_type c : Type :=
 forall d : cand, existsT (k : Z),
 ((PathT k c d) *
  (existsT (f : (cand * cand) -> bool), 
  f (d, c) = true /\ coclosed (k + 1) f))
  
Lemma wins_prop_type : forall c, 
 wins_prop c -> wins_type c.
Proof.  (* proof terms omitted *) Qed. 

Lemma wins_type_prop : forall c, 
 wins_type c -> wins_prop c.  
Proof.  (* proof terms omitted *) Qed. 	 
\end{minted}

The reason for two (rather than one) definitions of winning is that
the propositional formulation is easier to inspect for correctness.
Then again, the type level definition carries more information that
can be extracted, whereas the type-level definition carries
enough information that can be individually verified to corroborate
the correctness of the run of the algorithm, given the initial
datas. 
of our formalisation was two fold: i) extracting an OCaml 
code from it and using the OCaml code 
to count the ballots from real world elections and ii)
making it accessible everyone.  
\footnote{DP: What do you mean by this?}
To achieve the 
first goal, we use an elaborate  definition of winning at the type
level,
and for the second goal, we have a (simple) definition in Prop. 
All the reader has to do is inspect the simple logical defintion 
\textit{wins\_prop} to ensure that it correctly captures the notion 
of winner,  without understanding the more complex 
definition of \textit{wins\_type}.  The proof that these two definitions 
are equivalent is established in Coq, so the reader 
has to do is replay the proofs of  \textit{wins\_prop\_type} and 
\textit{wins\_type\_prop}.  Coq's extraction mechanism erases all the (logical) terms in sort Prop while 
keeps all the (computational) terms in sort Type. 


 \subsection{Condorcet Winner}
	A \textit{Condorcet winner} is a candidate who beats every other candidate in a 
	pairwise comparison, also known as head to head competition. 
	Recall from the previous section that the margin matrix,
  $\mathrm{marg}$, 
	stores exactly this data for every pair of candidates.
	Therefore, we define the Condorcet winner in Coq:

\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition condorcet_winner 
 (marg : cand * cand -> Z) 
 (c : cand) := forall d, 
 marg (c, d) >= 0.
\end{minted}
\footnote{DP: comment on strict Condorcet vs weak Condorcet
relatively to the margin $\geq$ or $>$?}

  Informally, the definition,  $\mathrm{condorcet\_winner}$ states that 
  if a candidate $c$  is the Condorcet winner, then they are
  ranked equal or higher against
  every other candidate in more ballots than vice versa. 
  Our goal is to establish that if there is a 
  Condorcet winner, then the Schulze method
  elects it. We formally state our intent 
  in Coq as:
 	
\begin{minted}{coq}
 Lemma condorcet_winner_implies_winner 
    (marg : cand * cand -> Z)
    (c : cand) : 
    condorcet_winner marg c -> 
    schulze_winner marg c = true. 
Proof.
  (* proof terms omitted *)
Qed.
\end{minted}
\footnote{DP: Why use the boolean function? And if the boolean
function is used, why are the propositional and type level functions
given earlier?}
\footnote{DP: Proof terms omitted can be omitted :-)}

  		
 The proof of $condorcet\_winner\_implies\_winner$ hinges on the two key observations:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item If a candidate $c$ is the Condorcet winner, then the generalised margin (matrix) 
  between $c$
  and every other candidate, say, $d$ would be greater than or equal to 0, i.e. 
  $M \text{ } (c, \text{ }d) \geq 0$.
  
  \item If a candidate $c$ is the Condorcet winner, then the generalised margin  (matrix)
  between every other candidate, say, $d$ and $c$ would be less than or equal to 0, 
  $M \text{ } (d, \text{ }c) \leq 0$.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 
 These two key observations make the proof of the lemma
 $\mathrm{condorcet\_winner\_implies\_winner}$ 
 trivial because we have $M \text{ } (d, \text{ }c) \leq 0$  and
  $M \text{ } (c, \text{ }d) \geq 0$, hence $M \text{ } (d, \text{ }c)  \leq 
   M \text{ } (c, \text{ }d)$. Intuitively, 
 if a candidate $c$ is the Condorcet winner, then the strongest path between her and every other 
 candidate, say, $d$ would be either a direct path or a more stronger path 
 via some other intermediate candidates (proof by induction on the path length). 
 In both cases, we have the generalised margin between 
 $c$ and the other candidate $d$ is greater than or equal to 0. 
 Similarly, for the second observation. We encode these two key observations in 
 Coq:
 
 \begin{minted}{coq}
Lemma first_key_observation : 
 forall c d n marg, 
 condorcet_winner c marg -> 
 M marg n c d >= 0.
Proof.
  (* proof terms omitted *)
Qed.

Lemma second_key_observation : 
 forall c d n marg, 
 condorcet_winner c marg -> 
 M marg n d c <= 0.
Proof.
  (* proof terms omitted *)
Qed. 
 \end{minted}

 \footnote{DP: again 'proof terms omitted' doesn't convey
 information.}

Proof of the last two lemmas is by induction on the path length, i.e. n \cite{Carre:1971:ANR}. 


\subsection{Reversal Symmetry}\footnote{It is not complete and still ongoing.}
 \textit{Reversal symmetry} is a voting method criterion which states that if the
 voting method has produced a unique 
  winner, say, $c$ based on the cast ballots, then $c$ should not be elected if the 
 individual choices were reversed. 
 In context of the Schulze method, we first need to define the unique winner, and ballot reversal. 
 
 \begin{minted}{coq}
 Definition unique_winner 
 (marg : cand * cand -> Z) 
 (c : cand) :=
 schulze_winner marg  c = true /\
 (forall d, d <> c -> 
  schulze_winner marg d = false).
\end{minted}  
\noindent
Informally, the definition of \textit{unique\_winner} states that a 
candidate $c$ is a unique winner
if it wins the election and every candidate 
other than $c$ loses the election.
We capture the ballot reversal in terms of margin matrix. For any given ballot set $P$, 
the margin between two candidates $c$ and $d$ is: 
\[
  \mathrm{marg}(c, d) = \sharp \lbrace b \in P \mid c >_b d \rbrace -
            \sharp \lbrace b \in P \mid d >_b c \rbrace
\] 

\noindent
If we reverse the individual choices in every ballot, the new margin
matrix, denoted as $\mathrm{rev\_marg}$, would be:

\[
  \mathrm{rev\_marg}(c, d) = -  \mathrm{marg} (c, d)  
\]    

\noindent
The connection between $\mathrm{rev\_marg}$ and $\mathrm{marg}$ is very intuitive, but it can be understood 
by considering a hypothetical single ballot election. Let's assume that we have 
a single ballot $(A, 1); (B, 2); (C, 3)$ and the interpretation is 
that $A$ is strictly preferred over $B$, and $B$ is strictly preferred over $C$ 
(but we do not need strict preferences to have this property).  The margin matrix
constructed from this ballot is: 

\[
\bordermatrix{ & A & B & C \cr
      A & 0 & 1 & 1 \cr
      B & -1 & 0 & 1 \cr
      C & -1 & -1 & 0 }
      \]
    
\noindent      
After reversing the original ballot, we get $(A, 3); (B, 2); (C, 1)$ and 
the margin matrix is:
\[
\bordermatrix{ & A & B & C \cr
      A & 0 & -1 & -1 \cr
      B & 1 & 0 & -1 \cr
      C & 1 & 1 & 0 }
      \]


\noindent
It is clearly evident from this example that the 
connection between $\mathrm{rev\_marg}$ and $\mathrm{marg}$  holds.
We capture this connection in Coq as:

\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition rev_marg 
   (marg : cand -> cand -> Z) 
   (c d : cand) := -marg c d.
\end{minted}

\noindent


Finally, the reversal symmetry property can be expressed in Coq as: 
\begin{minted}{coq}
Lemma reversal_symmetry : forall marg c, 
  unique_winner marg c ->
  schulze_winner (rev_marg marg) c = 
  false.
Proof. 
 (* still ongoing *)
\end{minted}

\noindent
The lemma $\mathrm{reversal\_symmetry}$ expresses that if a candidate $c$ is the unique 
winner, with respect to $\mathrm{marg}$ computed from some ballot set $P$, then she is 
a loser with respect to $\mathrm{rev\_marg}$, computed from reversing all the entries 
in the ballot set $P$.

\noindent
The proof this lemma is fairly straight forward \cite{Schulze:2011:NMC}, but 
Schulze's original paper assumes a key property which turns out to be very difficult to prove, 
at least in our encoding, in Coq. The key property is: if $M$ 
is the generalised margin 
matrix (step 4), computed using the margin matrix $\mathrm{marg}$
and $\mathrm{M\_rev}$ is the generalised 
margin matrix, computed using the margin matrix $\mathrm{rev\_marg}$, then 
$M\_M\_\mathrm{rev}: \forall \text{ } c \text{ } d,  M(c, d) =
M\_\mathrm{rev} (d, c)$ holds. Currently, 
we do not have the proof of $M\_M\_\mathrm{rev}$ in Coq, but we managed to prove 
another property, $\mathrm{path\_with\_rev\_marg}$, 
\footnote{DP: more detail}
that can be combined with 
some other properties to complete the proof of $M\_M\_\mathrm{rev}$. 

\begin{minted}{coq}
Lemma path_with_rev_marg :
  forall k marg c d,
  Path marg k c d <->  
  Path (rev_marg marg) k d c.
Proof.
(* proof terms omitted *)  
Qed.
\end{minted}
\footnote{DP: proofs omitted doesn't add information}

\noindent
$\mathrm{Path}$ is an inductive datatype that exactly captures the notion of 
sequence of nodes between two candidates (step 3). More elaborately, 
$\mathrm{Path} \text{ }k \text{ }marg \text{ }c \text{ }d$ a path $p$, sequence of candidates 
$p= (c,c_{1}, \dots ,c_{w},d)$, that joins $c$ and $d$ and the strength of 
p, $\mathrm{st}(p) =  \min \lbrace \mathrm{marg} (c_i, c_{i+1}) \mid 0 
\leq i \leq w \rbrace$, is greater than or equal to $k$. 

\noindent
The lemma $\mathrm{path\_with\_rev\_marg}$ states that if there is a path from 
$c$ to $d$ of strength $k$, with respect to $marg$, then we have 
a path of same strength $k$ from $d$ to $c$, with respect to
$\mathrm{rev\_marg}$. 
If this path from $c$ to $d$ happens to be the strongest path (step 4), 
then we can prove $M\_M\_\mathrm{rev}$.\footnote{The challenge in our encoding 
is proving that the strength of the strongest path is $\geq  M(c, d)$ and 
the strength of all paths is $\leq M(c, d)$ to infer the equality, 
i.e. strength of the strongest path $= M(c, d)$}
